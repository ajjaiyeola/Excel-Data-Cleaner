# Excel-Data-Cleaner

<h3> Problem </h3>
While doing sales prospecting, I noticed I was spending a lot of time copying and pasting individual names and contacts into Microsoft Excel. I needed a way to reduce the amount of time I spent manually entering data into Excel.


<h3> Solution </h3>

I created an Excel plug-in that analyzes a spreadsheet containing all of the unstructured sales data and correctly pulls out the "Name", "Email","Company Name", and "Title" for each individual prospect. Instead of having to switch between screens to copy and paste four times per prospect (one copy and paste per data point), I only have to do so no more than one time per prospect now.
